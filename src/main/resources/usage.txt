Usage: java -jar ruian2pgsql-*.jar:jdbc-driver.jar com.fordfrog.ruian2pgsql.App <options>

Where:
jdbc-driver.jar
        is JAR file containing database driver (either PostgreSQL or MySQL)
--convert-to-ewkt
        if enabled, GML strings from the source XML files are first converted to
        EWKT and then stored in database, otherwise original GML strings are
        stored in database (choose this option based on Postgis level of GML
        implementation)
--create-tables
        creates database tables for the data (if tables with the same name
        already exists, it is first dropped)
--db-connection-url <value>
        is JDBC connection URL, for example:
        jdbc:postgresql://localhost/ruian?user=ruian&password=p4ssw0rd
--dry-run
        processes all specified files but no data are written to database
--debug
        if used, debug information are output
--input-dir <value>
        is directory that contains downloaded .xml.gz files
--log-file <value>
        is optional specification of log file (if not specified, log will be
        output to console)
--no-gis
        ignores all GIS information (Geometrie element) in the input XML file
--ignore-invalid-gml
        if GML definition is not valid, application ignores the definition and
        saves the object without the definition (if this parameter is not
        specified, application throws exception and exits while trying to save
        invalid GML definition, the drawback of this parameter is that it makes
        the import little bit slower because each GML definition is checked
        twice - once during the check and the other time during saving in
        database)
--reset-transaction-ids
        resets RÃšIAN transaction ids so that following data import will update
        all data (data are updated only if new transaction id is greater than
        transaction id that is stored in database - this feature is useful in
        case you want to regenerate your data because of some issue with
        previous import, without deleting all data and starting with fresh
        database)
--dest-srid <value>
        is optional integer identifier of coordinate system to which will be
        the geometries transformed
